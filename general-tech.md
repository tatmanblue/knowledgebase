# Communications Tech Comparisons

REST — Utilizes HTTP methods for operations which provides a consistent API interface. Its stateless nature ensures scalability, while URI-based resource identification provides structure.

GraphQL — Unlike REST it uses a single endpoint. GraphQL uses a single endpoint, allowing users to specify exact data needs, and delivers the requested data in a single query.

SOAP — Once dominant, SOAP remains vital in enterprises for its security and transactional robustness. It’s XML-based, versatile across various transport protocols, and includes WS-Security for comprehensive message security.

gRPC — Offers bidirectional streaming and multiplexing using Protocol Buffers for efficient serialization. It supports various programming languages and diverse use cases across different domains.

WebSockets — Provides a full-duplex communication channel over a single, long-lived connection. It is ideal for applications requiring real-time communication.

MQTT — A lightweight messaging protocol optimized for high-latency or unreliable networks. It uses an efficient publish/subscribe model.
